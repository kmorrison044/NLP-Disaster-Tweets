# NLP-Disaster-Tweets

Smartphones have equipped us all with the ability to immediately announce an emergency whenever we encounter one. Because of this, several disaster-relief organizations are interested in monitoring twitter to be up-to-date on the most recent disasters people may be encountering.

In this project, given twitter data with labels indicating whether a tweet contains an emergency or not, the goal is to build a ML model that is able to predict if tweets contain emergency information in them.
